# Gig Challenge

### Installation

```sh
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

### Test

```sh
$ npm test
```
### Description

- This project uses create-react-app.
- Lint based on standard JS, standard style and standard react lint recommendations.

### Issues

- Select, Date and Radio Button placeholders are not looking as the provided design. Possible solution handling them with JS.
- Better managing of height in the fields. Possible solution, a better reset style.

### Improvements
- Best test control, visually and functional, perhaps a better structure of check visibility function into function helpers to unit test them.
- Deeper check on cross browser and manage better auto fill on forms.
- Position of valid icon fields more standard, maybe use set background approach instead.
- Pure react app, might use redux forms for a wider control on validations
